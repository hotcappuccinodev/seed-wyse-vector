 * architecture. However, most PHP framework users may be used to accessing classes through
 * a variety of static methods. Laravel provides "facades" to simulate this behavior while
 * still using heavy dependency injection.
 *
 * Each class that is commonly used by the developer has a corresponding facade defined in
 * this file. All of the various facades inherit from the abstract Facade class, which only
 * has a single __callStatic magic method. The facade simply resolves the requested class
 * out of the IoC container and calls the appropriate method.

	 * and testability while still accomodating the common desire to conveniently
	 * use classes via static methods.
