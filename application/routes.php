	| Here is the public API of your application. To add functionality to your
	| application, you just add to the array located in this file.
	|
	| Simply tell Laravel the HTTP verbs and URIs it should respond to. It is a
	| breeze to create beautiful applications using the simplicity and elegance
	| of Laravel's RESTful routing.
	|
	| Let's respond to a simple GET request to http://example.com/hello:
	|
	|		'GET /hello' => function()
	|		{
	|			return 'Hello World!';
	|		}
	|
	| You can even respond to more than one URI:
	|
	|		'GET /hello, GET /world' => function()
	|		{
	|			return 'Hello World!';
	|		}
	|
	| It's easy to allow URI wildcards using (:num) or (:any):
	|
	|		'GET /hello/(:any)' => function($name)
	|		{
	|			return "Welcome, $name.";
	|		}
	|
