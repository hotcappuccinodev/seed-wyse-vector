	| each time it is created. For example, you may wish to bind a header and
	| footer partial each time the view is created.
	|
	| The composer will receive an instance of the view being created, and is
	| free to modify the view however you wish.
	|
	| For more information, check out: http://laravel.com/docs/start/views#composers
